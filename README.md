# TASK-7-DATA-SCIENCE

# 🛒 Basic Sales Summary from a Tiny SQLite Database using Python

## 📌 Task Objective

This project demonstrates how to connect a Python script to a small SQLite database and extract basic sales summary information. It includes SQL queries executed via Python, basic data visualization using matplotlib, and simple printed output using pandas.

---

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries

- Python (built-in sqlite3)
- pandas for data manipulation
- matplotlib for visualization
- SQLite database (sales_data.db)

---

## 📂 Files Included

- sales_summary.py — Main Python script for database creation, querying, and visualization.
- sales_data.db — The SQLite database (auto-generated by the script).
- sales_chart.png — Output bar chart showing revenue by product.
- README.md — Documentation for the project.

---

## 🗂 Dataset

A sample sales table is created with the following columns:

| Column   | Type    |
|----------|---------|
| id       | INTEGER |
| product  | TEXT    |
| quantity | INTEGER |
| price    | REAL    |

Sample data is inserted into the table within the script itself.

## 📈 Output

The script outputs:
- A printed sales summary showing:
  - Total quantity sold per product
  - Total revenue per product
- A simple bar chart visualizing revenue by product
- Optionally saves the chart as sales_chart.png
